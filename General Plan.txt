Hardware
- Shield for Arduino Uno
- Inlcudes Pushbuttons, single color leds, RGB leds, Potentiometer, switches, Transceiver, 
           Servo pin headers, buzzer, analog sound sensor, 1 digit 7-seg display,
	   AND/OR gates with test points/digital outputs into arduino for coms display
- Include test points if people wanna measure the hardware
- make this thing absolutely fool proof, shouldnt need much because of shield nature
  * reverse polarity on things like pin headers and so on



Software
- include full versions of code so people can see what should happen
- include seperate code files so people can take it step by step
- include templates kind of like a lab for a class that people can follow and fill in on
- talk about mapping with analog sensors
- terminal IO


In general
- Make this as accessible and interesting as possible
- try and get the ball rolling for project ideas.. maybe people will like different stuff?
- the goal is plug and play and to get people code fast.. even if they cant get stuff to 
  work they should still be able to see things happen so they are interested
- keep this relatively cheap. we already have arduinos and can buy stuff in bulk so 
  hopefully this shouldn't cost too much
